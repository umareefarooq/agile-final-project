This is the final assignment in the agile development and scrum course for IBM DevOps certification

**Final Project Overview and Scenario**

**Overview**

Now that you have been equipped with the knowledge and skills to create sprint plans, you will have the opportunity in this final project to practice and apply it by creating stories, assembling them into a product backlog, refining them to produce a sprint plan, and perform a mock sprint that involves moving stories across your kanban board as your team would do in a real sprint.

**Final project scenario**

In this scenario, you will play the roles of a product owner, scrum master, and developer. As a product owner, you will create stories for your team and organize these stories into a product backlog. As a scrum master, you will create a sprint milestone and ensure that a subset of the stories is ready to be placed in a sprint plan. As a developer, you will create the sprint backlog and execute some of the stories by moving them across the kanban board in a simulated sprint.

Your team has been tasked with developing the back-end product catalog for an e-commerce website. Stakeholders require the ability to create, retrieve, update, and delete products from the catalog, along with features like indicating product likes and hosting on a cloud environment with automated deployments.

Your team will use a kanban board to create a backlog and sprint plan for this work. As the product owner, you will drive the process by leveraging the skills learned in the lessons and labs to create a new GitHub repository and kanban board and fill the kanban board with issues that will become user stories.

Note:
-If you have opted to use GitHub Projects for your Kanban board, please continue using it for your final project. Alternatively, if you have used Zenhub to create a Kanban board, you may use it for your final project as well.

**Stakeholder requirements**

Following are the requirements from your stakeholders that you should use to create the user stories in Kanban board.

Need the ability to create a product in the catalog.

Need the ability to retrieve a product from the catalog.

Need the ability to update a product in the catalog.

Need the ability to delete a product from the catalog.

Need the ability to Like a product in the catalog.

Need the ability to Dislike a product in the catalog.

Need the ability to list all products in the catalog.

Need the ability to query a subset of products in the catalog.

Must be hosted in the cloud.

Must have automation to deploy new changes to the cloud.

**Instructional tasks**

To help you finish the final project, we have provided a list of instructional tasks to guide you:

Create a new GitHub repository called agile-final-project and ensure it is public.

Create a Project in your GitHub repository and name it Final Project.

Create an issue template for the new repository similar to the labs.

Create issues for the stakeholder requirements listed above (10 in total). Fill in the As a… I need… So that… section of the template.

Move requirements 7 and 8 issues into the Icebox.

Move the remaining issues into the Product Backlog.

Conduct a Backlog Refinement meeting and rank the Product Backlog to match the requirements order.

Update the top 5 stories in the Product Backlog with acceptance criteria following the Gherkin Given… When… Then… syntax.

Create a technical debt label.

Add labels of either enhancement or technical debt to all stories in the Product Backlog.

Create a sprint milestone with a duration of 2 weeks, named Sprint.

Conduct a Sprint Planning meeting. Add the top 4 stories to the sprint, assign them to the sprint milestone, and assign story point estimates. Move these 4 stories to the Sprint Backlog.

Simulate a sprint by assigning the top story to yourself. Move it to the In Progress column.

Move the story to Review/QA. Take the next story from the Sprint Backlog, assign it to yourself, and move it to the In Progress column.

Move the story in Review/QA to Done. Move the story from In Progress to Review/QA. Take the next story off the Sprint Backlog, assign it to yourself, and move it to the In Progress column.

Move the story in Review/QA to Done. Leave the story in the In Progress column where it is. This marks the end of the sprint.

Ensure your burndown chart displays correctly.

Share the URL of your kanban board for peer review.
